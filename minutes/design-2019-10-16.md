## topic

How to handle normalization in chalk and ideas about what a generic
library to represent types might look like.

## summary

Key points in the discussion:

* [how does normalization work in chalk today](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144729-wg-traits/topic/meeting.202019-10-16/near/178314511)
* [would like to remove unnormalized projections and move that logic to clause lowering](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144729-wg-traits/topic/meeting.202019-10-16/near/178315108)
* [but this makes lowering more complex](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144729-wg-traits/topic/meeting.202019-10-16/near/178315630)
* [can use generics to keep things straight](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144729-wg-traits/topic/meeting.202019-10-16/near/178315802)
* [and in particular a typefamily trait](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144729-wg-traits/topic/meeting.202019-10-16/near/178316023)
* [this typefamily trait can be the foundation for a generic type library](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144729-wg-traits/topic/meeting.202019-10-16/near/178316849)
