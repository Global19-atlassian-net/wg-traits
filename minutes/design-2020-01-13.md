* [type representation, `Ty` vs `TyData`](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144729-wg-traits/topic/design.20meeting.202020.2E01.2E13/near/185527502)
* [`Alias` enum representation](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144729-wg-traits/topic/design.20meeting.202020.2E01.2E13/near/185528001)
* [rust-analyzer bug around truncation](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144729-wg-traits/topic/design.20meeting.202020.2E01.2E13/near/185529345)
* [meeting summary](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144729-wg-traits/topic/design.20meeting.202020.2E01.2E13/near/185531717):
    - `Alias` might make sense as one enum variant, or maybe three
    - We want to bring rustc and Chalk's types closer together/merge
    - @**detrumi** is going to try to reimplement `impl Trait`
    - We should try to just remove truncation and instead just `Flounder` (Jack will try)
    - performance/cancellation is the next big thing if we remove truncation & related errors
