    - We do want to try to extend both rustc and chalk.
    - Need to come up with a plan for chalk integration into rustc (Niko)
    - Need to come up with goals for chalk (Jack)
    - Need to put together what needs to be done for chalk-ir changes (Niko)
    - One way to maybe help performance would be to cache program clause creation
    - Should think about potential other solvers
    - Going to add tracing into chalk (David and Jack)
    - Going to create projects on wg-traits to get organized
