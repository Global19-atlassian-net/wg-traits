# wg-traits sprint 2020-03-31 .. 

**Pulled from https://hackmd.io/kYWsWI9IS0213x0qX_1RDw on 2020/5/14**

* Goal: Rustc integration MVP ([tracking issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/wg-traits/issues/18))
    * Initial integration work landed
    * Made a lot of progress towards extending chalk to support builtin types and traits
        * Currently using some hacks in rustc for some of them
    * Next steps:
        * Extend chalk to be able to represent all of the Rust types [chalk#368](https://github.com/rust-lang/chalk/issues/368)
        * Connect rustc types to the builtin chalk types
        * Auto trait handling for builtin chalk types
        * Handling int and float literal inference variables
        * Region / outlives integration
        * Bound inference variables, perhaps?
* Goal: Plan for what const integration looks like ([tracking issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/wg-traits/issues/15))
    * Held [initial meeting](https://zulip-archive.rust-lang.org/144729wgtraits/23279designmeeting20200407.html) and designed a minimal subset
    * Implementing a [pending PR](https://github.com/rust-lang/chalk/pull/393) which uncovered some interesting questions about how to represent constants
    * Next steps:
        * [Resolve `GenericArg` handling](https://github.com/rust-lang/chalk/issues/452)
        * Land [chalk#393](https://github.com/rust-lang/chalk/pull/393) which will offer basic constant support
    * it has been reviewed and we are working out the [list of test cases](https://hackmd.io/Ah_J6nFQSbuUiVOsH5acLg)
    * next steps:
        * incorporate some mention into the chalk book
* Goal: Move towards alignment of rustc and chalk types, and towards extracting a shared library ([tracking issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/wg-traits/issues/16))
    * [Doc from meeting](https://hackmd.io/roRq0qHMQ6CyRJxj_FsPSQ)
    * Extended chalk types to support builtin rust types and traits
    * Refactoring of predicates on rustc side to be interned and match chalk conventions [rust-lang/rust#72055](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/72055)
    * Next steps:
        * Finalize naming conventions and rename as necessary
        * Create issues around rustc side
* Goal: basic support for impl Trait ([tracking issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/chalk/issues/335))
    * basic support has landed: [PR #324](https://github.com/rust-lang/chalk/pull/324), :tada: 
    * working now on adding better generics support
    * [Next steps](https://github.com/rust-lang/chalk/issues/335#issuecomment-615254659)
* Goal: progress towards removing leak check in rustc ([tracking issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/59490))
    * Landed [#70950](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/70950) which aligns NLL with lexical checker
    * but to truly remove leak check we have to resolve some back-compat interactions
    * Next steps:
        * rustc refactoring to move leak check to occur later, which unblocks lazy norm and a few other changes
        * explore a smarter variant of leak check that takes into account implied bounds and is able to continue accepting wasm-bindgen
* Goal: exploration and research
    * exploring recursive solver (flodiebold)
        * initial version has landed and been integrated into rust-analyzer
        * Follow-up items:
            * fix coinduction [chalk#399](https://github.com/rust-lang/chalk/issues/399)
            * revisiting the chalk-solve crate structure
            * documenting how it works in chalk-book
            * comparison between it and SLG checker
    * explore converting semantic-to-syntactic equality
        * [draft PR opened](https://github.com/rust-lang/chalk/pull/401)
    * create a chalk file from any given program
        * [draft PR opened](https://github.com/rust-lang/chalk/pull/430) and it's starting to work
* Goal: increase Chalk performance (very open-ended)
    * Create a set of benchmarks
        * no progress
    * Add tracing support
        * opened a [draft PR](https://github.com/rust-lang/chalk/pull/409)
    * Track memory usage and try to decrease as necessary
        * no progress
* Goal: add more to Chalk book
    * Added [chalk big picture](http://rust-lang.github.io/chalk/book/#high-level-view-of-how-chalk-works) material
    * Moved content from [rustc-dev-guide](https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/traits/chalk-overview.html)
    * Added [table tracking the well-known traits](http://rust-lang.github.io/chalk/book/clauses/well_known_traits.html#current-state)
    * Next steps:
        * glossary and notation for common terms
            * the `?0` notation
            * the `^0` notation
            * the `!0` notation
            * what is a "bound variable", an "inference variable", and a "placeholder variable", and what do they *mean* semantically
